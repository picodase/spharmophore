# Spharmophore design document

## Understanding the Problem
Create a Python module that generates a pharmocaphore and a set of possible leads using a structure-based, dynamics-considerate, optimization-first, and finally energy-minimizing approach. [Read the program steps here](parts/strategy.md)

## Assumptions

## Pros and Cons of this program
- PRO: Does not involve superposition of an ever-incomplete library of ligand-bound structures, and thus doesn't re
